## Test generateStaticParams

```bash
#in order to test ISR(incremental Static Regeneration)
npm run build 
```

> Incremental static regeneration (ISR) is the architecture behind Next. js that allows pages to be updated after a site has been built and deployed. Compared to server-side rendered (SSR) pages and statically-generated pages, ISR pages have distinct advantages. They are not rebuilt for each user, so they load quickly
