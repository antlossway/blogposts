# Understanding useEffect hook

Understanding the component lifecycle and how the UI is rendered on browser is essential on the journey
of React, it can reduce the bugs caused by misunderstanding the concept.

Here is a great article that break down the component rendering process.

## mental model of rendering a simple counter component

```
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> ## To make sure we have a solid understanding, let’s recap our first render:
> 
> React: Give me the UI when the state is 0.
> Your component:
> 
> Here’s the render result: <p>You clicked 0 times</p>.
> Also remember to run this effect after you’re done: () => { document.title = 'You clicked 0 times' }.
> React: Sure. Updating the UI. Hey browser, I’m adding some stuff to the DOM.
> Browser: Cool, I painted it to the screen.
> React: OK, now I’m going to run the effect you gave me.
> 
> Running () => { document.title = 'You clicked 0 times' }.

> ## Now let’s recap what happens after we click:
> 
> Your component: Hey React, set my state to 1.
> React: Give me the UI for when the state is 1.
> Your component:
> 
> Here’s the render result: <p>You clicked 1 times</p>.
> Also remember to run this effect after you’re done: () => { document.title = 'You clicked 1 times' }.
> React: Sure. Updating the UI. Hey browser, I’ve changed the DOM.
> Browser: Cool, I painted your changes to the screen.
> React: OK, now I’ll run the effect that belongs to the render I just did.
> 
> Running () => { document.title = 'You clicked 1 times' }.

## Key takeout

- each render has its own states and props, sees its own state values
- each render has its own Event Handlers
- each render has its own Effects
