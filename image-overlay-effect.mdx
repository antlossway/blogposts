# Image overlay effect experiments

Basically there are two approaches, one is setting background image, the other is using "img" HTML element.

## Codepen

      <Iframe

## background-image approach

The advantage of using background-image is that the image will automatically live behind the containing text of icons.

### background-blend-mode

This method simply add `background-color` and `background-image`, then use `background-blend-mode: multiply`.

```
bg-[url('xxx')] bg-indigo-600 bg-blend-multiply
```

### linear-gradient + image

This is also a simple method, the vanilla CSS syntax of `background-image` can specify multiple images, including `linear-gradient`.
The images are drawn on stacking context layers on top of each other.

```
bg-[linear-gradient(rgba(70,130,180,.8),rgba(178,34,34,.8)),url('xxx')]
```

### mix-blend-multiple

This is a complicated method. I will not use it unless no other choices. But this is an interesting approach that we can learn about stacking context.

## image approach

This is also quite complicated approach.

### Conclusion

I found that the best text readability is achieved with `background-blend-mode: multiply`. The same result can be achieved with `mix-blend-mode: multiply`, but the code is too complicated to understand.

So the winner is:
simply apply background-color and background-image and then put in a multiply blender.

```
bg-[url('xxx')] bg-indigo-600 bg-blend-multiply
```
