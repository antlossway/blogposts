## mental model of rendering a simple counter component

```
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key takeout

- each render has its own states and props, sees its own state values
- each render has its own Event Handlers
- each render has its own Effects
